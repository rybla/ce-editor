# TODO

- [x] drag from one point to another
  - [x] save origin point until done dragging
  - [x] if points are siblings, then make cursor
  - [x] if points make a selection, then make selection
  - [x] otherwise, put cursor around nearest common ancestor node
- [x] two kinds of handles: ones with foci and ones without
  - there are `SpanH` and `ZipperH` which do not have foci, and `Handle` which does have a foci
- [x] how to deal with top level being a span or not? it makes a lot of sense for the logic in Expr for the top level to be a span. but does it always?
  - useful cases:
    - `atSpan`
    - `atZipper`
  - not useful cases:
    - rendering (since then I need to manufactor a Root Expr component)
  - **answer**: top level is still Root, but now we also have a Context type for encoding a Zipper that is from a top Expr (often, the Root Expr) specifically
- [x] adjust ends of handle with mouse
  - [x] adjust ends of span with mouse
    - [x] test if this works
  - [x] adjust ends of zipper with mouse
- [ ] what happens when paste a span on a zipper handle? 
  - [x] currently, just replaces the entire zipper+inside with the pasted span, but this isn't what _should_ happen, probably
- [x] need different kind of tooth at bottom of zipper
- [x] Escape to move handle to beginning of file
- [x] Backspace to delete stuff inside handle
- [x] undo and redo
- [x] better console message filtering
- [x] bug when pasting (a zipper, for example), it goes around teh top level expression rather than the span handle
- [ ] keyboard movement
  - [x] move point around
  - [ ] shift+move to emulate drag
    - [ ] there are some weird behaviors
- [ ] query textbox
- [ ] shift-click to emulate dragging from source handle to that target point
