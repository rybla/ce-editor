- selecting entire subexpr vs just parens around 
- pasting zipper 
  - _replaces_ when at zipper
  - _wraps_ when at span 
    - should probably replace, since that's what happens when you paste at a selection 
  - no strong intuition about what should happen when you delete a zipper (where cursor goes)
- fake parens in rendering can be confusing
