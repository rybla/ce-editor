- tab should go ot other side of parens  (move forward)
  - shifts should go in other direction
- shift-space should go back 
  - special case
- close paren should move past a paren
- when delete a paren, should go inside teh right of hte selection 
- to put a zipper around something, place cursor _before_ it rather than around 
- when move across grouping boundaries, doesnt quite go where expected (when move from inner to outer, should go to the innermost)
- when paste a zipper at a zipper,  is intuitive 
- grouping with "(" should be more intuitive
- dont like in text editors when inserting right paren for you
  - IMPORTANT: need to be able to type ")" to go past it too
- zap movement doesnt need to be invertible
