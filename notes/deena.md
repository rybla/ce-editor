- when paste a zipper at a span, expect to replace span 
- when paste a zipper at a zipper,
  - 1. wraps around the inside

- delete at the end of a let
- up/down movement
- moving cursor in a zipper slection position is more intuition
- feels like figuring out where th parentheses should go automatically at fist rather than you managing it explciitly
